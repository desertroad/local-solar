# Local Solar

The library is to calculate the position of the sun at a specific moment and
the times of events such as sunrise and sunset.

Astronomical knowledge was referenced from Wikipedia and various websites.


## Purpose
Since this information can be easily calculated on mobile devices and is useful, 

I aimed to provide implementations in various programming languages, especially targeting mobile platforms.


## Approach
Many of the implementations I've researched take into account the Gregorian calendar system and the local time zone.

However, the actual position of the Sun moves independently of these factors. 

Therefore, I aimed to create a simpler implementation that doesn't depend on these two systems.


## Implementations
+ [JVM (kotlin)](jvm)
+ dart : planned
+ swift : planned
+ python : planned
